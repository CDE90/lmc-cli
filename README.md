# LMC CLI Program

An example implementation of my LMC assembly language as a CLI program.

This uses my [lmc-assembly](https://github.com/CDE90/lmc-assembly) library.

## Usage

```bash
lmc-cli --program <path to program>
```

## Example

Copy an example from the [library repo](https://github.com/CDE90/lmc-assembly/tree/master/examples) to the current directory.

```bash
lmc-cli --program sum.lmc
```
